# Both libfakeroot-sysv.so and libfakeroot-tcp.so have a SONAME of
# libfakeroot-0.so, so this link will be created by ldconfig anyway.
# But ldconfig will not clean this up again if
# /etc/ld.so.conf.d/fakeroot-*.conf got removed first. Since the link
# is never used by fakeroot, it does not matter to which library it
# points.
